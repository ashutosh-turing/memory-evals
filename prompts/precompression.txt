## 🎯 Your Analysis Mission

I need you to carefully examine these code changes and provide a thorough, **fact-based analysis**. Please focus on:

### 🔍 **Step 1: Understanding the Purpose**
- What problem is this PR trying to solve?
- What feature or improvement is being added?
- Is this a bug fix, enhancement, refactor, or new feature?

### 🏗️ **Step 2: Technical Implementation**
- How do the code changes work together?
- What are the key functions, classes, or components being modified?
- Are there any new dependencies or architectural changes?

### 🔗 **Step 3: Impact Analysis**
- Which parts of the system will be affected?
- Are there any potential breaking changes?
- How do the changes in different files relate to each other?

### ⚡ **Step 4: Quality Assessment**
- Is the code well-structured and readable?
- Are there proper error handling mechanisms?
- Do you see any potential issues or improvements?

## ⚠️ **Important Guidelines**

**✅ DO:**
- Base your analysis only on the actual code shown
- Quote specific lines or functions when making points
- Explain technical concepts clearly
- Identify patterns and relationships between files
- Point out both strengths and potential concerns

**❌ DON'T:**
- Make assumptions about code you can't see
- Speculate about features not evident in the changes
- Invent functions or classes not present in the files
- Make claims about system behavior without code evidence
- Add your own opinions about what "should" be done

Take your time to read through each file carefully. I'm looking for a comprehensive but accurate analysis based solely on what you can observe in the provided code. Ready to begin?
