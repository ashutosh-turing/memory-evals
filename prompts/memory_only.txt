# 🧠 Memory-Only Analysis Phase

## ⚠️ **CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: MEMORY-ONLY MODE**

**You are now entering a memory-only phase.** This is a crucial test of your retention and understanding. Here's what you MUST do:

### 🚫 **STRICT RULES:**
- **DO NOT** look back at, reference, or quote the original file contents
- **DO NOT** access any previous code snippets or documentation
- **ONLY** use information that you remember from our previous analysis
- If you don't remember something clearly, say "I don't recall" rather than guessing

### ✅ **WHAT TO USE:**
- Your memory and understanding from the previous analysis phases
- Insights you formed while examining the code
- Patterns and relationships you identified
- Key technical concepts you learned

## 💡 **Response Guidelines**

**Be Honest About Your Memory:**
- If you remember something clearly, explain it confidently
- If you're unsure, say "I believe..." or "My recollection is..."
- If you don't remember, say "I don't recall this detail"
- Focus on the aspects that made the strongest impression on you

**Stay Grounded:**
- Only discuss what you actually analyzed
- Don't fill in gaps with assumptions
- It's better to have fewer details than incorrect details
- Focus on the most memorable and impactful aspects

Remember: This is testing your ability to retain and synthesize information from your analysis, not your ability to guess or reconstruct details you didn't fully process. Quality of recall is more important than quantity.
